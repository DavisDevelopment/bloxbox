# BloxBox (temporary title)
 Prototype for a voxel (block) based god game.
Being prototyped for the moment in JavaScript/Web, to be re-prototyped in JavaScript/GraalJS/Java, and likely eventually ported entirely to Java, scriptable via JavaScript.

### Quick Start
Just clone the repo and open `main.html` in your browser and that should start up the latest build. 
More detailed instructions coming soon probably

#### Project's Aim (as of now)
---

 A 2D/3D god game which is also a block-based sandbox/civilization simulator, in wich the player can participate from multiple perspectives.
The worlds will be 3D, finite for now and populated with various terrain features and little voxel people who live in little voxel villages. Little voxel-trotting agents, who will be known for now as Villagers. Villagers will gather materials from their surroundings and assemble a village. 


 - God POV: The world may be viewed and manipulated from above/outside, using various powers to manipulate its terrain and occupants. 
 - DemiGod POV: The world can be navigated and manipulated from the first person, with access to various godlike abilities.

 That's all for the moment, lest I get ahead of myself
